# AutoMapper tests

## Get a valid license
To run the AutoMapper tests, you need a valid license for AutoMapper. 
You can obtain a license from the [AutoMapper website](https://automapper.io).

## Configure the license
Once you have obtained a valid license, you need to configure it in your test project.
- add the license key to a "License.txt" in this same folder as this readme file.
- make sure "copy to output directory" is set to "copy if newer"/"always copy" for the License.txt file.

## Run the tests

## Note
Make sure to keep your license key secure and do not share it publicly.
For this purpose .gitignore is enforced to ignore the License.txt file.
